        <p>
          Set in Harare at the height of Zimbabwe's economic woes in 2008, Sweet
          Medicine tells the story of Tsitsi, a young woman who seeks agency and
          financial security through a clear-eyed (some might say cynical)
          reliance on patriarchy and the spiritual world. It explores the
          breakdown of the middle class, the turn to traditional/spiritual
          solutions for modern problems, and the lengths one will go to survive.

      const questions = [
        "In the context of Zimbabwe's economic collapse, is Tsitsi’s reliance on 'Sweet Medicine' (spiritual intervention) a sign of desperation or resourcefulness?",
        "How does the novel critique or explore the role of the church and traditional beliefs in modern Zimbabwean society?",
        "Compare Tsitsi's journey to Lewa's in 'Sugar Daddy Chronicles'. Both use their bodies and relationships for security. How do their justifications differ?",
        "What does the book suggest about the fragility of the middle class in times of national crisis?",
        "How is the relationship between education and success portrayed? Does the book suggest that education failed Tsitsi?",
        "Discuss the role of feminism in the novel. Is Tsitsi a feminist character in her own way, or does she uphold patriarchal structures?",
        "The title 'Sweet Medicine' suggests a cure that is palatable. What is the 'medicine' in the story, and is it truly sweet?",
        "How does the author use the setting of Harare to create atmosphere and tension?",
        "What role do the secondary female characters (like her mother or friends) play in shaping Tsitsi’s decisions?",
        "Did the ending satisfy you? What does it say about the sustainability of the choices Tsitsi made?",
