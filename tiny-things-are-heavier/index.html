        <p>
          Sommy, a Nigerian woman, comes to the United States for graduate
          school two weeks after her brother, Mezie, attempts suicide.
          <br /><br />
          Plagued by the guilt of leaving Mezie behind, Sommy struggles to fit
          into her new life as a student and immigrant. Lonely and homesick, she
          soon enters a complicated relationship with her boisterous Nigerian
          roommate, Bayo, a relationship that plummets into deceit when Sommy
          falls for Bryan, a biracial American whose estranged Nigerian father
          left America immediately after Bryan’s birth.
          <br /><br />
          During summer break Sommy and Bryan visit Lagos and meet a shocking
          and unexpected event exposes the cracks in Sommy’s relationships and
          forces her to confront her notions of self and familial love.
