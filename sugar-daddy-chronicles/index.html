        <p>
          When Sisi brought me to Lagos for work, I didn't expect to have sex
          for money or to sexually debase myself for the pleasure of Nigeria's
          corrupt/morally bankrupt elite. But I realized early on that I don't
          really mind it - it is a journey I am willing to take to reach the
          destination of the life I want. However, the journey gets bumpy
          quickly; my secret plans and growing affection for Sisi's right-hand
          man and in-house diviner, Dimeji, bring me into a headlong collision
          with her. There's also the effect of the oath I swore before the
          goddess of the graveyard, which will haunt me to death. I try to fight
          it, but one thing's for sure, I'm not likely to leave this place
          alive.

        "How does Lewa's initial mindset and situation shape the decisions she makes throughout the story?",

        "Sho is a Babalawo and also part of the luxury world Lewa enters. How does his dual role affect your perception of him and the relationship he has with Lewa?",
        "The novel uses ritual and spiritual elements (oaths, traditional practice) alongside modern luxury. What is the significance of blending these two worlds?",
        "How does the setting (Lagos, with its glamour and grit) function as a character in its own right?",
        "In what ways do the sugar-daddy transactions reflect broader themes of class, power and commodification?",
        "Can Lewa's choice to participate in the system be viewed as agency or entrapment? Or a mixture of both?",
        "How does the author portray desire and pleasure, especially from a female protagonist's perspective?",
        "How do you respond to characters who are morally grey (neither purely good nor purely evil)? Does this enhance or complicate the reading experience?",
        "What do you think the novel says about the cost of “escaping poverty” in a system that demands more than it promises?",
        "There are moments of betrayal, loyalty and shifting allegiances. Which betrayal hit you the hardest and why?",
        "The book ends (without major spoilers) with a sense of transformation. What does freedom look like for Lewa? Is it something she attains, or something she must keep fighting for?",
        "If you were advising Lewa, at a key turning point in the story, what would you tell her and why?",
        "The author uses sensual, erotic scenes as part of the narrative. How do you feel about the role of erotica in telling a story with serious themes?",
        "What aspects of the story stayed with you after finishing the book? Why?",
